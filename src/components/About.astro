      I am a computer engineering student, self-taught frontend and lover of the JavaScript ecosystem.
      Passionate about code, technology and development; adaptable and persevering, curious since I can remember and always looking for new things to learn. <br><br>
      I usually develop projects that are impactful and useful, as well as small practice projects that help me to continue increasing my coding skills.
